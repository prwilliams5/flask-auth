# Data Center Power Usage Web App

The current purpose of this application is for monitoring power usage in a data center facility. There are future plans to integrate many other systems to increase data center and network operations center efficiency, so this is just the start! If there are any ideas to improve or add functionality please reach out! So far, the application stack runs Python, Flask, and a SQL database with features such as:

- Built-in scalability
- Application and database security
- Easy to set up SQLite3 database for testing with minimal code changes for more robust SQL solutions
- Multiple database upgrade paths including PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Python SQL toolkit, SQLAlchemy integration
- Error handling with logging
- Unit testing
- Email support with automated user password recovery
- User AAA
- Individual user profiles
- Message board for communicating with other users

## Future Plans

- Live notifications
- Pagination and Search Bar
- Power usage tracking for individual power circuits and PDUs
- Monitoring analytics and metrics dashboards
- Track, add, remove, and edit cabinets/racks
- Expanded API capabilities
- Modern front-end web design with React
- Documentation: "Getting Started" section in README
